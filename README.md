## Architecture

SecurePass follows a modern, secure architecture designed for scalability and performance:

### Frontend Architecture
- Server Components for improved performance
- Client Components only where interactivity is needed
- Modular component structure with atomic design principles
- Responsive layouts using Tailwind's mobile-first approach
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling

### Security Architecture
- Zero-knowledge encryption using AES-256
- Client-side encryption before data transmission
- Secure key derivation using PBKDF2
- Salt and pepper for password hashing
- Rate limiting and brute force protection
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### State Management
- Zustand for global state
- React Query for server state
- URL state management with nuqs
- Local storage encryption for sensitive data
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### Database Schema
- Users table with encrypted metadata
- Encrypted vaults for password storage
- Audit logs for security monitoring
- Separate schemas for different data types

### API Architecture
- RESTful endpoints with versioning
- GraphQL for complex data requirements
- Rate limiting middleware
- JWT authentication
- CORS protection

### Deployment
- Vercel for frontend hosting
- Edge functions for improved latency
- CDN for static assets
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
- Regular backups and disaster recovery
